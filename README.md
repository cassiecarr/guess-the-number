##Guess the Number

The function asks the user to enter a range of numbers and then guess
the number the program has randomly selected within the range.
It continues to ask the user giving hints (too high, too low), until
they have successfully guess the correct number.

##Example
```python
##To begin run
guess_the_number()
```
